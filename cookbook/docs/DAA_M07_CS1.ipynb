    "# Py: Classifying review sentiment\n",
    "**This notebook was originally created by Rob Daly for the Data Analytics Applications subject, as *Case study 7.1 - Classifying automative reviews* in the *DAA M07 Natural language processing* module.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Analytics Applications is a Fellowship Applications (Module 3) subject with the Actuaries Institute that aims to teach students how to apply a range of data analytics skills, such as neural networks, natural language processing, unsupervised learning and optimisation techniques, together with their professional judgement, to solve a variety of complex and challenging business problems. The business problems used as examples in this subject are drawn from a wide range of industries.**\n",

    "### Purpose:\n",
    "This notebook walks through the use of NLP to analyse customer sentiment. The objective of the case study is to identify 'complaints' from a sample of YELP reviews for automotive companies. YELP is a North American review service where customers review different service providers. Reviewers write a text review and are then asked to rate the service on a five point scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### References:\n",
    "The dataset that is used in this case study was sourced from a Kaggle competition in which YELP provided a set of reviews: https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "It contains information about businesses across 8 metropolitan areas in the USA and Canada.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this case study, the dataset has been refined to contain 50,000 reviews for companies tagged as 'automotive'."

      "Thought their alignment / oil change package was a good deal on Groupon so I bought it and took in my truck. My left front ball joint was dry as a bone and a little squeaky when I dropped it off. When I got it back the manager, an older honest looking white guy, told me my ball joint was shot and so were my shocks and that I'd need to put a few grand into the repairs in the near future if I wanted to keep her on the road. He said they did what they could with the alignment but it wouldn't stay out with such a damaged joint. Needless to say the alignment went out of whack quickly. Took the truck in to a friend at another shop and it turns out the guys at Fletcher's had loosened the joint to make it worse and left it dry in an attempt to con me. All it needed was a tightening and some lube. I hate to leave negative reviews but this place is trouble and you guys need to know about it.\n",

We went to the dealer looking for a Panamera. We had another trade in for them to look at. We found a silver Panamera that we liked and the salesman ( not named to protect the guilty) said he would give us a great deal. We probably should have walked out then when he said that. I gave him the vin# for the trade in and he then put everything into the computer. After about 10 minutes of plugging everything in he then left to supposedly talk to his manager to \"give us a great deal.\" After another 10 minutes he came back with a lowball trade in number which he claimed was from KBB,  and also virtually nothing off the Panamera...he previously said that they wanted to move the car and it would show in the numbers he was going to give me. I then gave him my printed copy of the KBB  dealer trade in value which was $10,000 higher than his trade in number. He must have sized us up and thought we were stupid. We then left. The next day I called my old dealership and one more on an identical Panamera, and not only received the KBB trade in value, but also $8,000 off the new Panamera. It was pretty obvious that Gaudin was just trying to pick us off. Needless to say we will never go back even for servicing on our cars.\"\n",

I was advised if my seat was an easy fix there would be no charge. If it was more complicated they would have to charge me. Fair enough. I brought my car in at the scheduled time. I was told 2 hours so I decided not to wait. No shuttle was offered so I called for a ride. Over 4 hours later I received a call that my car was ready. I showed up and they were just finishing drying my car. I was handed my keys and was told my car was washed, recall fixed and my seat fixed. No charge. I was not given any paperwork for what was done on my car. I thought it was odd but figured it was because I wasn't charged anything. I was thrilled. The next day I needed to take my seats out. My seat was still jammed!!  I called immediately. Was told the Service dept was closed but a manger would definitely call as I should have been given paperwork on what was completed and she also said it was unacceptable that I was told a service was preformed and it wasn't. I am not even sure if the recall issue was completed. I never received a call from the manager of the service dept. I am extremely unhappy with the (lack) of service and follow up. I will never again go back. They obviously don't care about their customers.\"\n",

      "\" CAUTION!!!!!! DO NOT GO HERE!!!! If I could I'd give this place a -5 star!!! That's the first red flag u should know. I have a long story & from reading ALOT of reviews id say about 98% of them r poor reviews about this place. About 5 of them r very similar to mine. So here's my horrible story and experience...It was last month in Oct of 2015 ,I've been hearing about the Tent sale on 83rd between Bell rd & T-bird. Sale started Oct 22nd. So I have a 2014 Crystler 200 & it was my first car I've owned, by this time I had it for about 7 months. My heart was set on a Kia Optima but ended up settling for the 200. So when we get there we are given a person to take us around to look at cars. We were with 2 guys, Brian & Tavo from Vans Chevy. Before I go on, Tavo is an amazing nice guy that is very honest, very helpful so I have nothing bad to say about Tavo. Anyways, Brian shows me a few white optimas but eventually I see a black one w/ black rims, pretty much wanted it . I test drove it & all. Sat down & we negotiated a lot mainly on payments. I wanted 0 down & $350/month. I wanted 0 down because I did not have anything to put down but my trade in & had to make my payment for my 200 on Oct 27th of $330. Brian told me after all the negotiations, ok how about u put down $330 of the payment u were gonna do for the 200 & I said, R u sure I can do that since I have to make that payment for my 200? He said yes, once you sign over the 200 to us you don't have to make payments to them. So I believed him & ended up doing $375/month for the Kia, which we financed with Sammy. Brian also stated that my credit score was great. So I had a good feeling no need for a cosigner which I didn't have for my 200. We swapped keys & the Kia was mine ! I finally felt like I was complete with the car I've been wanting and it was perfect for our baby on the way! About a week goes by & Sammy calls letting me know about the banks he's seeing which one will take the loan. In the mean time my credit union calls me a day after my payment for the 200 was due asking for the payment so I told them,car is not in my possession I traded it in & Brian told me I don't need to pay for this month. The credit union guy tells me that I'm still responsible for my loan payment until they do the pay off. I told him no that's not how it works & they told me diff,I don't have to pay u guys it's not in my possession. About a week & a half goes by & Sammy is asking if I have a cosigner. I say no. Try the TruWest bank my 200 is through.They accepted me. After almost two weeks I try calling & calling his number to speak with Sammy. I can't get through and I leave messages to the front desk to have him call me back . Days go by-nothing. I even call over there while I'm at work to see if he called the credit union, supposedly he said he did but I doubt he did cuz when I spoke w/ credit union they have no notes or record of them calling.\n",
      "I'm getting really impatient by now & it's taking longer than it should . I keep calling & finally speak w/ Sammy & he said we still \"need\" a cosigner to do this deal so I give him my fiancés info & I know for sure they could check if he qualifies in no less than 5 min. It took him another week & a half to tell me he wasn't approved either. I felt like he kept us in the dark & this whole time I'm still wondering if the Kia is going to be mine. At this time it's almost been 3 weeks of attempting phone calls to him. The girl just says he's with customers and I tell her to have him call me back & he doesn't for days.Credit union calls me letting me know that I'm being put into collections cuz of how late my payment is. We decide to drive all the way over there on nov 20th to see what is actually going on & we drove 20miles to speak w/ the finance manager. I told him the situation & said its been pretty Much a month & your finance guy hasn't pushed anything through. He was shocked,but I'm sure this isn't the first time . He had us sit & wait for a sales manager to help us. We sit & wait & wait, 40 min we are still waiting & I'm pissed so we just left back home. I called the next day to speak with the general manager & the lady said he was in a meeting and I asked how long,she said 2 hours. I said ok I'll call back but I just called back & left my name and number & said its really urgent and regarded Sammy w/ finance.Not even 30 min passed & GM called me. I told him my situation & he was very rude. I said you get all the paper work done Today cuz I'm getting my 200 tomorrow! He Didn't apologize & just said,So u are coming in tomorrow? I said Yes. He just bluntly said,Ok see u tomorrow. We get there & see Tavo. I told him I'm here to get my 200. He was shocked cuz he told us that the guys were just passing my file around not getting it done.they told Tavo to stay out of it & he's they one who was pushing it to get done. Overall I got my 200 back&Brian&Sammy didn't come out to like scared liars&cheaters! Never go here! Dont get anything done! \"\n",
