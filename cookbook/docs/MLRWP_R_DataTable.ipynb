    "## Why use data.table?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of reasons for choosing `data.table`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is very fast and memory efficient, even for large data sets\n",
    "* Actively maintained and used by many people\n",
    "* No dependencies other than baseR\n",
    "* Flexible\n",
    "* Concise syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are other options for manipulating data. \n",
    "Popular choices include dplyr from the tidyverse suite, SQL software, or even just the tools in baseR. \n",
    "In this post we will focus on `data.table`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Now for the details\n",
    "\n",
    "### data.table is fast\n",
    "\n",
    "`data.table` is much faster than dplyr or baseR for data manipulation tasks and can handle larger datasets.\n",
    "All development of data.table is done with speed in mind. It uses a number of tricks to produce better performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adding or removing columns from a data.table are done by reference or modifying in place, rather than by copying the entire table to a new location in memory.\n",
    "* A data.table may have a key - once the key is created, extracting subgroups or joining tables by that key are extremely quick. Similarly, secondary indices allow fast access for other variables.\n",
    "* `data.table` supplies a number of optimised functions - e.g. `fread()` and `fwrite()` to read/write CSV files, `fifelse()`, `fcoalesce()`. `fread()` and `fwrite()` are so fast that there are many people who use the `data.table` package solely to access these functions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Some benchmarks for data manipulation are maintained at https://h2oai.github.io/db-benchmark/. \n",
    "Timings are given for datasets of different sizes - as data sets get larger, `data.table` really shines. \n",
    "Google data.table performance and you will find this message repeated in many places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning and large amounts of data often go hand-in-hand. \n",
    "So if you are doing your data manipulation in R, and have large amounts of data, you should strongly consider using `data.table`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if a lot of your work involves programming with large amounts of data, or where speed and memory optimisation is important, then `data.table` has a lot to offer."
