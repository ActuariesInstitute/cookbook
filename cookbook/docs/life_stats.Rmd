# Background 
APRA release Australian life industry data on performance quarterly at a product level as well as aggregated results by company. Bi-annually APRA release other statistics on lapse rates, new business rates, decline rates and market share. I have visualised these datasources in Tableau. I have also added an r script which could be used to extract results from the APRA data.

Tableau public is a free to use visualisation tool that can ingest data in a number of different formats and is useful at creating flexible visualisation. Gephi is an open source graphing platform that has a number of algorithms that can automatically spread the points (nodes) of a network and their connecting lines (edges) into set of points that can be combined with other data and visualised in Tableau. You could also create a visual in Gephi, but Tableau has a number of other useful tools.

See link above to GitHub repository which has data and tableau workbook for this recipe.

# Introducing radial bar charts
A radial bar chart is a bar chart plotted in polar co-ordinates rather than a Cartesian plane. [This site](https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/jack-parry/create-a-radial-bar-chart-in-tableau) sets out a very simple approach, which I have used here.

# The result

A preview of the final visualisation is below (click through to Tableau):

# Using r to view industry stats
As with most data sources, an alternative visualisation tool is r. The below extracts the individual disability income profits and revenue and calculates the margin.

```{r Industry stats in r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, class.source='fold-show'}
# this script reads in the APRA data and produces a few graphs for presentation

packages <- c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "readxl", "lubridate", "scales", "xtable")
install.packages(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())))  
for (package in packages) {
    library(package, character.only = TRUE)
}

percent0 <- function(value) {
  return(percent(value, accuracy = 0.1))
}
