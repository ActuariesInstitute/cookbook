# Actuaries' Analytical Cookbook

*"Actuaries can be at a loss as to where to begin. But they often have the problem statement already.  What my teams have found useful are a few simple off the shelf solutions tailored to them that they can expand on. Given that, they usually pick it up an run with it. "*

A cookbook of data and analytics recipes to help actuaries quickly get started with a new project, this
site is intended to be a resource to actuaries in both data science and traditional fields. Contributions are welcome - the project can be found on Github at [https://github.com/ActuariesInstitute/cookbook](https://github.com/ActuariesInstitute/cookbook).
