The business problems used as examples in this subject are drawn from a wide range of industries.**\n",

    "\n",
    "Best Toy supplies four major toy retailers. Each quarter, the toy retailers submit orders to Best Toy to be delivered weekly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Toy incurs the following costs:\n",
    "\n",
    " * costs to produce each toy—this cost varies by warehouse and by retailer (each retailer has slightly different specifications for their version of the toy); and\n",
    " * costs to deliver each toy—this cost varies by the distance between the warehouse and the retailer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of Best Toy’s warehouses has a maximum production capacity. Assume that all warehouses are open and no additional costs are incurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Toy must fulfil the orders from each retailer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Toy wishes to determine how many toys to produce at each of its warehouses for each retailer to optimise its costs. Let:\n",
    " * $w_{i}$ denote each warehouse, where $i∈{1,2,3}$;\n",
    " * $r_{j}$ denote each retailer, where $j∈{1,2,3,4}$;\n",
    " * $p_{i,j}$ denote the cost of producing one toy by warehouse $i (w_{i})$ for retailer $j (r_{j})$;\n",
    " * $d_{i,j}$ denote the cost of delivering one toy from warehouse $i (w_{i})$ to retailer $j (r_{j})$;\n",
    " * $q_{i,j}$ denote the quantity of toys produced by warehouse $i (w_{i})$ for retailer $j (r_{j})$;\n",
    " * $D_{j}$ denote the quantity of toys ordered by retailer $j (r_{j})$; and\n",
