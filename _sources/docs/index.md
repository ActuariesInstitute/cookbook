# Actuaries' Analytical Cookbook

*"Actuaries can be at a loss as to where to begin. But they often have the problem statement already.  What my teams have found useful are a few simple off the shelf solutions tailored to them that they can expand on. Given that, they usually pick it up an run with it. "*

A cookbook of data and analytics recipes to help actuaries quickly get started with a new project, this
site is intended to be a resource to actuaries in both data science and traditional fields.

Use the left sidebar (on desktop) to navigate materials. The download icon on the top right allow downloading files as .ipynb or .pdf. The rocket icon allows running the code - as live code and in Google Colab. Currently both work for Python snippets only and Colab requires a Google account.

This is an initiative by the [Young Data Analytics Working Group](https://actuaries.asn.au/microsites/actuaries-in-data-analytics/people-and-network/young-data-analytics-working-group-%28ydawg%29), a working group with the [Actuaries Institute](https://actuaries.asn.au/) championing data analytics for young and young-at-heart actuaries.

Contributions are welcome - the project can be found on Github at [https://github.com/ActuariesInstitute/cookbook](https://github.com/ActuariesInstitute/cookbook).
